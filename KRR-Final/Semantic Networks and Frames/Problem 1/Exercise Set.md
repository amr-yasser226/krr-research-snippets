### Fruits Semantic Network
Create a semantic network for different fruits.  
- Start with a central node labeled **“Fruits.”**  
- Create branches for different categories of fruits, such as **“Citrus,” “Berries,” “Drupes.”**  
- Expand each category by adding specific fruits and their characteristics, such as **“Orange”** (peelable, sweet taste, orange color), **“Lemon”** (sour taste, yellow color), **“Strawberry”** (seeds outside, red color), **“Cherry”** (stone pit, red color).
