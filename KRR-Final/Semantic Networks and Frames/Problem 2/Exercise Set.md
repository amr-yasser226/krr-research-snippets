### Computer Components Semantic Network
Create a semantic network for computer components.  
- Start with a central node labeled **“Computer.”**  
- Branch into **“Hardware”** and **“Software.”**  
- Under **Hardware**, include **“CPU”** (executes instructions, GHz speed) and **“RAM”** (volatile, GB size).  
- Under **Software**, include **“OS”** (manages hardware, user interface) and **“App”** (performs task, installable).
