## 2. Family Relationships
**2a.** Create a semantic network to represent family relationships:
- Nodes: individuals A, B, C, D.
- Links: A is parent of B; A is parent of C; B is parent of D; C is sibling of B.
- Use the network to answer:
  - Who is the uncle of D?
  - What is the relation between A and D?
- If B has blue eyes and C has brown eyes, infer D's eye color.

**2b.** Represent this network using frames.
