## 4. Car Network
**4a.** Design a semantic network for a car:
- Start with **"Car"**.
- Branches: **Body Type**, **Engine Type**, **Features**, etc.
- Expand with **Sedan** (four doors, spacious, fuel-efficient), **SUV** (large size, off-road capabilities, high seating position), **Hybrid** (combines petrol/diesel engine with an electric motor), etc.

**4b.** Represent this network using frames.
