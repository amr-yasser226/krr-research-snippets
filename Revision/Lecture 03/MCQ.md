### Question 1:

Which rule of inference allows you to conclude _q_ from the premises _p_ and _p_ → _q_?

A. Modus Tollens  
B. Hypothetical Syllogism  
C. Modus Ponens  
D. Disjunctive Syllogism

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> C. Modus Ponens. It directly derives _q_ from _p_ and _p_ → _q_. </details>

---

### Question 2:

Given the premises ¬_q_ and _p_ → _q_, which conclusion follows?

A. _q_  
B. _p_  
C. ¬_p_  
D. ¬(_p_ ∧ _q_)

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> C. ¬_p_. This is Modus Tollens: from ¬_q_ and _p_ → _q_, infer ¬_p_. </details>

---

### Question 3:

Which rule lets you infer _p_ ∨ _q_ from _p_ alone?

A. Addition  
B. Simplification  
C. Resolution  
D. Conjunction

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> A. Addition. It allows extending a true proposition into a disjunction. </details>

---

### Question 4:

From _p_ ∧ _q_, which rule allows you to derive _p_?

A. Conjunction  
B. Simplification  
C. Hypothetical Syllogism  
D. Disjunctive Syllogism

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> B. Simplification. It extracts one conjunct from a conjunction. </details>

---

### Question 5:

If _p_ → _q_ and _q_ → _r_ are both true, which rule justifies _p_ → _r_?

A. Modus Tollens  
B. Resolution  
C. Hypothetical Syllogism  
D. Conjunction

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> C. Hypothetical Syllogism. It chains two implications into one. </details>

---

### Question 6:

Which rule applies to these premises?

1. _p_ ∨ _q_
    
2. ¬_p_  
    ∴ _q_
    
    A. Disjunctive Syllogism  
    B. Resolution  
    C. Addition  
    D. Conjunction
    

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> A. Disjunctive Syllogism. It removes the false disjunct to conclude the other. </details>

---

### Question 7:

Given clauses _p_ ∨ _q_ and ¬_p_ ∨ _r_, what is the result of applying Resolution?

A. _p_ ∨ _r_  
B. _q_ ∨ _r_  
C. _q_ ∨ _p_  
D. ¬_p_ ∨ ¬_q_

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> B. _q_ ∨ _r_. Resolution eliminates _p_ to combine the remaining literals. </details>

---

### Question 8:

What is the intuition behind Modus Ponens?

A. If _q_ is false, _p_ must be false  
B. If _p_ is true and implies _q_, then _q_ is true  
C. From _p_ ∧ _q_, infer both _p_ and _q_  
D. From either _p_ or _q_, discard one to get the other

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> B. If _p_ is true and implies _q_, then _q_ must be true. </details>

---

### Question 9:

Which of the following is **not** a standard rule of inference covered?

A. Conjunction  
B. Transposition  
C. Addition  
D. Simplification

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> B. Transposition. It wasn’t listed among the common seven rules in the lecture. </details>

---

### Question 10:

In building multi-premise arguments, you often:

A. Use exactly one inference rule  
B. Chain several inference steps  
C. Rely solely on truth tables  
D. Avoid using derivations

<details> <summary>Answer</summary> B. Chain several inference steps. Complex arguments require multiple rules in sequence. </details>
